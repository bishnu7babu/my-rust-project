# Guess The Number Game
Welcome to the "Guess The Number" game, a simple command-line game written in Rust. In this game, the player has a limited number of chances to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## How to Play
1. **Set the Number of Chances:**  
   First, the game will ask you to enter the number of chances you want to guess the number.

2. **Set the Range:**  
   Next, you'll be asked to set the range of numbers (from 1 to your chosen number).

3. **Start Guessing:**  
   The game will then ask you to guess the number within the given range. After each guess, you'll be informed whether your guess was too small, too big, or correct.

4. **Winning and Losing:**  
   - If you guess the correct number within the allotted chances, you'll win!
   - If you run out of chances without guessing correctly, you'll lose.

## Example
Here's an example of how the game might proceed:

```bash
Game:: Guess The Number
Chance = 5
Range 1 to 100
<----------------------------------------------->
Input Your Guessing Number = 50
Left Chance = 4
Too small!
---------------------------------------------
Input Your Guessing Number = 75
Left Chance = 88
Too big!
---------------------------------------------
Input Your Guessing Number = 63
Left Chance = 57
Too small!
---------------------------------------------
Input Your Guessing Number = 69
Left Chance = 70
Too big!
---------------------------------------------
Input Your Guessing Number = 66
You Guessed = 66 ðŸ˜Š
Congratulations, You winðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š!
```
